Simple News App
===============

This is a simple app that pulls news entries from NewsAPI.

Notes:
1. To load the API key, you need to update the key in `src/key.js` ( I didn't want to post the given key to github )
2. You need to press the search button to search; Hitting enter won't trigger a search
3. I didn't get around to implementing the popularity filter.

To Run:
A simple `npm install install; npm start` should launch the app
